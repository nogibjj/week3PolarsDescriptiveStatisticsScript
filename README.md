# week3PolarsDescriptiveStatisticsScript
## Description
In this project, I read nba.csv file using polar. This file contains many players with name, team, number, position, age, height, weight, college and salary. Then i calculate mean, min, max, standard deviation and median for this dataset. Then i print the result to terminal for data visualization. Finally, I used matplotlib to generate age distribution graph shwon in Age_distribution.png.

## Sample Output
